# ArduinoHVP

This sketch is based on the ArduinoISP sketch.

It is used to upload a sketch to an ATTINY85 microcontroller using a High-Voltage Programmer (HVP).

The fuses can also be set using this program.

## Use

Connect the Arduino to the ATTINY85 as shown at https://www.rickety.us/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/diagram.png

Upload the sketch to the Arduino

Upload a sketch to the ATTINY85 using the 'Arduino As ISP' programmer.

ALSO: The ATTINY85 fuses can be set by opening a Serial console (19200 Baud) and typing 'Z'.
